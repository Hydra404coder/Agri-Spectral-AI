# Agri-Spectral-AI

AgriSpectral AI is a software-only fruit quality detection system that emulates AS7265x spectral sensors using open hyperspectral datasets to predict apple freshness, spoilage risk, and pesticide residues.

## About

AgriSpectral AI leverages spectral analysis to assess the quality of apples, providing insights into:

- **Freshness**: Determining the ripeness and shelf life of apples.
- **Spoilage Risk**: Identifying early signs of decay or spoilage.
- **Pesticide Residues**: Detecting traces of pesticides to ensure safety.

By emulating AS7265x spectral sensors, the system offers a cost-effective solution for quality assessment without the need for specialized hardware.

## Features

- Software-Only Detection: Eliminates the need for physical spectral sensors.
- Open Hyperspectral Datasets: Utilizes publicly available datasets for training and validation.
- Predictive Analysis: Provides accurate predictions on apple quality metrics.
- User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, even for those with minimal technical expertise.
